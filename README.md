Notes I took while learning ros2 HUMBLE HAWKSBILL!!!

# ROS2(Robot Operating System 2)
### Essentially it works kind of like unreal engine blue prints semantically but the individual nodes can be a lot
### more abstracted and also include hardware sensors, motors and other programs

# Nodes
### kind of like python modules that do their own thing

```
```

# Topics
### this is essentially like the middle layer that will send data over from one node to another in
### a continous manner

```
```

# Services
### kind of like topics but they follow a caller and response model rather than a publisher and subscriber model like topics
### generally for one and done type of communication rather than continous

```
```

# Parameters 
### Are configuration values of a node
### 

```
```
